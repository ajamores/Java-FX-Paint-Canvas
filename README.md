# Java-FX-Paint-Canvas
I have developed a JavaFX Paint Canvas project that mimics the functionalities of Microsoft Paint. The project includes a GUI that allows users to draw different shapes, lines, and freehand drawings on a canvas. I have implemented polymorphism to create different types of shapes such as circles and squares. Additionally, I have incorporated error handling to ensure the smooth running of the application without any crashes. I have also implemented association and inheritance to make the code more organized and reusable, making it easy to maintain and expand the project in the future. Overall, the project showcases my skills in Java programming, GUI design, and software development."
