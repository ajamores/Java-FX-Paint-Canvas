# Java-FX-Paint-Canvas
I have developed a JavaFX Paint Canvas project that mimics the functionalities of Microsoft Paint. The project includes a GUI that allows users to draw different shapes, lines, and freehand drawings on a canvas. The program implements polymorphism to create different types of shapes such as circles and squares. In addition, association and inheritance have been used to create more organized and reusable code, making it easier to maintain and expand the project in the future.

To ensure a smooth user experience, I have also incorporated error handling throughout the program. This includes handling null and invalid input, as well as preventing crashes and exceptions. These error handling techniques make the application more robust and user-friendly.

Overall, the project showcases my skills in Java programming, GUI design, and software development, including the use of object-oriented principles such as polymorphism, association, and inheritance, as well as best practices for error handling.

**Features**

Draw different shapes, lines, and freehand drawings on a canvas.
Implemented polymorphism to create different types of shapes such as circles and squares.
Incorporated error handling to ensure the smooth running of the application without any crashes.
Implemented association and inheritance to make the code more organized and reusable, making it easy to maintain and expand the project in the future.

**Installation**

To use this program, you need to have Java and JavaFX installed on your computer.
Download or clone the repository.
Open the project in an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
Run the program.

**Usage**

To draw a shape, select the desired shape from the toolbar on the left side of the screen.
The shape, size, and color at a minimum must be provided to draw.
To draw the shape, click and drag the mouse on the canvas
To change the color and size of the shape, use the color and size options on the toolbar.
To erase a shape, select the eraser tool.
